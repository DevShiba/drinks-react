# Mix Masters

This project is a web application that allows you to search for a variety of drinks. If you choose a drink, you can view its name, category, ingredients, instructions, and other information to make the drink yourself. The project uses Styled Components for CSS styling, Vite for improved performance, React Query for data handling, Toastify for pop-up notifications, React Router for a better navigation, and Axios for fetching data from the [API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com).
